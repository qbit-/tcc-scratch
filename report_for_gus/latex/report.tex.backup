\section{Description}

As was shown earlier, Coupled Cluster can be solved approximately by imposing 
some tensor decomposition with low number of parameters on cluster amplitudes. By combining 
this with an approximation of the Hamiltonian and the "energy denominator" tensors
variants of Coupled Cluster theorie with low scaling can be produced. 
In this notes the results for Canonical Decomposition of amplitudes, RI decomposition
of the two electron integrals and canonical decomposition of energy denominator are 
listed. 
As a reminder, RI and CPD decompositions are defined as

\begin{equation}
V_{ijkl} = \sum_{pq}^{R_{v}} W^{1}_{ijp} \cdot S_{pq} \cdot W^{2}_{qkl}  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
T^{2}_{ijab} = \sum_{t}^{R_{t}} X^{1}_{it} \cdot X^{2}_{jt} \cdot X^{3}_{at} \cdot X^{4}_{bt}  
\end{equation}

In this work I sligthly modified CPD decomposition of $T^{2}$ to force the columns of
$X^{n}$ to have unit norms. The normalized decomposition is defined as
\begin{equation}
T^{2}_{ijab} = \sum_{t}^{R_{t}} \Lambda_{t} X^{1}_{it} \cdot X^{2}_{jt} \cdot X^{3}_{at} \cdot X^{4}_{bt}  
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is a vector containing weights of the normalized factors. The new decomposition 
is denoted as nCPD, and seems to have almost identical properties to the original one.
All discussed Coupled Cluster codes were derived both for CPD and nCPD decomposed amplitudes.

\section{Approximation properties}
let us start with the discussion of the RCCSD-CPD. Energy behavior versus the rank of CPD for various 
systems is shown below.

The performance of the method has distinct features in two regimes: weak and 
strong correlation. In weak correlation regime the errors are small. In strong
correlation regime the difference between approximate and regular coupled cluster
may be large, but approximate solutions have a better behavior compared to regular ones.

We have to note that the method is not convergent for large ranks at strong correlation.
Normal Coupled Cluster is also non convergent by naive iterations unless damping of DIIS is 
used. However, I have not found a way to do damping properly in the current implementation. 
This aspect needs more thinking and experimentation. Additionally, CC methods with 
decomposed amplitudes may require a lot a iterations to converge.
\section{Weak correlation}
Let us estimate how well the approximation works in the weak correlation case. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/err_vs_r_u_2_cpd.eps}
\end{figure}

For weak correlation difference in the energy between RCCSD-CPD and classical RCCSD
decays exponentially with respect to the decomposition rank, which is less than $N^2$. 
We have to note that a fixed $U=2$ does not set an equivalent correlation strength
for tested Hubbard models.

\section{Strong correlation}
It's interesting to note that in stron correlation limit very low rank decompositions 
seem to generate solutions with good physical behavior. Let us look at other 
parameters of Coupled Cluster in this regime. We consider a $10$-site Hubbard with PBC at $U=2$.


\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}

Decomposed amplitudes are not exact solutions of CC equations. As correlation strength
grows doubles residuals of RCCSD-CPD grow (and equations are getting harder and harder to converge).
As the rank grows those residuals decrease, as decomposed solutions are becoming better and 
better approximations to the conventional CC amplitudes.

$T^{1}$ amplitudes are, however, true solutions to CC equations, because we do not approximate them. 
This results in $T^{1}$ amplitudes becoming non-zero at convergence as they adapt to approximate $T^{2}$,
while they should be zero for Hubbard models due to symmetry. As the rank of the decomposition grows 
$T^{1}$ amplitudes go to their expected values (zero).

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}

Let us look at the norm of $T^{2}$.
As was found in PoST and Attenuated-CC works, the cause of the bad performance
of Coupled cluster in strong correlation regime is the grows of higher order
CC amplitudes. It turns out that low rank structure of $T^{2}$ has an effect of 
regularization. As the rank grows $T^{2}$ amplitudes are getting less regularized 
and grow to their conventional values.

\end{figure}


Finally, let us look at the norms of individual components of $T^{2}$ amplitudes, 
as we keep them in the normalized form (RCCSD-nCPD). The first component 
behaves similarly to the norm of amplitudes.

The full spectrum, however, does not have a distinct dominant mode in low 
and in large
